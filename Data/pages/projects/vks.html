        "I challenged myself by using Eclipse and JSP, which I learned in Japan, to clone 
        the website of the District 8 Prosecutor's Office. The main programming language 
        used is JSP."
        <br>
        <br>
        "This website is related to the prosecutor's office and includes functions such as 
        a news page, document page, contact page, and basic functionalities of a typical 
        website. This website was created quite some time ago and is still unfinished. 
        At that time, I joined her group to support them. Currently, I have to work on 2D 
        and 3D game projects for Green Academy, so this project will likely not be continued."
