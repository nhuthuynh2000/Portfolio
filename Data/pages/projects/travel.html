        "I collaborated with my group at the University of Natural Resources and 
        Environment to create a travel-related website, where I was primarily 
        responsible for the front-end. This website is mainly built using HTML, 
        CSS, and JavaScript."
        <br>
        <br>
        "The website provides tourists with various information related to famous 
        landmarks, must-try dishes, news, as well as information about Ho Chi Minh 
        City, where I live."
        <br>
        <br>
        "This project is incomplete in many areas due to the backend not being finished 
        on time. The group requested that I remove the unfinished sections, but I 
        decided to keep the menu."
