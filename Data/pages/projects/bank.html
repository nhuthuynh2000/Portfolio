        "I created banking management software for employees (users)
        and administrators (admins). Admins have all privileges,
        while users have limited permissions. This software was built
        using WinForms, with C# as the main programming language. 
        The database is constructed using SQL."

        "This software provides CRUD functionality for accounts, customers, 
        and transactions for both users and admins, while also allowing for 
        money transfers, withdrawals, and deposits. Admins have CRUD functionality 
        for the employee table, enabling them to add or terminate employees."

        "This software was created in 6 hours, and I tried to challenge myself within 
        a short time frame, but I failed. Since this software was created as a speedrun 
        challenge, there may still be some undiscovered and unresolved bugs."
