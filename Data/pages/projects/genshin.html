        "I have been working on a project to simulate the movement mechanics found in Genshin Impact, one of my favorite
        games, with the goal of creating my own version featuring characters from my imagination. To achieve this, I
        utilized various Unity packages, such as Terrain and ProBuilder, to design the levels."
        <br>
        <br>
        "This game is a personal project that I am developing for myself, and it is still in the early stages. I have
        successfully implemented movement mechanics, including running, sprinting, walking, jumping, falling, and
        rolling. Currently, I am pausing development to prepare for my 3D project at the
        Academy."
        <br>
        <br>
        "This experience has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to explore movement systems and level design while
        drawing inspiration from a game I truly admire. I look forward to continuing this project in the future and
        bringing my vision to life!"
