        "I have a game that is a click RPG similar to VLTK, Kiếm Thế, and Diablo. I am utilizing the latest technology
        in
        Unity 6, featuring many new mechanics such as Animator Override, Saving System, Change Weapon, and more.
        <br>
        <br>
        I aim to provide players with an exciting adventure experience, allowing them to decide the direction of their
        character, whether they want to be a powerful wizard or a brave warrior. There will be a quest system to help
        players learn more about the world, as well as challenging enemies and bosses with various mechanics."
