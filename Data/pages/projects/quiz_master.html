        "Ask and answers, a trivia quiz game that features one question and four answer choices. At the start of the
        game, random questions are selected from a pool of Scriptable Objects containing various questions."

        <br>
        "In this project, I have implemented a countdown timer; if players do not answer in time, they lose the game.
        This feature adds an extra layer of excitement and urgency to the gameplay."
        <br>
        <br>
        "Throughout this project, I have learned to effectively use Scriptable Objects, honed my object-oriented
        programming skills, created a user interface, and explored many other new concepts in game development. This
        experience has greatly enhanced my understanding of building engaging games and managing game state. I am
        excited to continue developing my skills and creating more interactive projects in the future!"
