    "I was truly surprised when, on the first day of the new year, the deputy manager of my shop was transferred to
    another branch. I was promoted to deputy manager. In just seven months, I learned how to manage the team, oversee
    daily operations, handle customer complaints, train new staff, and ensure high-quality service."

    <br>
    "This involved multiple projects and iteratively communicating with clients, using feedback in order to tailor
    solutions to their needs. During this time I mostly worked with the following tools; Tensorflow, Python, C++ and the
    Qt framework."

    "I started to become more proficient in my work and completed tasks more quickly. The manager began to let me handle
    the shop on my own. I felt a sense of trust. By the end of the year, I was taught how to close out the day, assign
    tasks, and manage inventory. I feel like I am about to be promoted to deputy manager."

    "I started working part-time at a ramen shop named Ichiraku on Harajuku Street. Since it was my first job,
    everything was very new and I felt quite nervous. However, thanks to the manager and the supportive coworkers
    around me, I adapted well and performed my tasks effectively, earning the affection of many coworkers."
