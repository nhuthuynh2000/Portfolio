        "I have developed a 2D top-down shooter game that features a survival mode without an endpoint. Players continue
        until their character dies. Throughout the game, players can level up and upgrade their weapons to combat
        increasingly powerful monsters that grow stronger over time."
        <br>
        <br>
        "To enhance the gameplay experience, I added four unique skills for players: fire breath, shield creation,
        attack enhancement, and lightning strike. This variety of skills adds depth and strategy to the game, allowing
        players to adapt their tactics based on the situation."

        "As this is my graduation project at the Academy, I placed a strong emphasis on UI design, sound effects, and
        animations. I learned a great deal from this project, particularly how to save player statistics using
        PlayerPrefs, including strength, currency, and high scores. This experience has significantly enriched my
        understanding of game development and the importance of creating an engaging player experience. I look forward
        to applying these skills in future projects!"
