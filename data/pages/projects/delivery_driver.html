            "My delivery Driver offers an exciting experience for players as they control a delivery car in a
            colorful world. In the game, when the car passes over a pink square, it changes color to pink and enters a
            delivery state. Players must drive to a blue square to deliver the goods before returning to pick up more
            from
            the pink square."

            "On the map, there are yellow triangles; whenever the car passes over one, it will accelerate until it
            collides
            with an obstacle. This creates thrilling moments and encourages players to seek out the yellow triangles to
            improve their delivery performance. However, when colliding with obstacles such as houses, rocks, or trees,
            the
            car will slow down if it is in a state of acceleration. This requires players to be skillful in their
            control to
            avoid collisions while maximizing their speed to complete delivery tasks."

            "A unique aspect of the game design is the absence of a health bar. This truly helps players feel relaxed
            and
            comfortable during gameplay. Instead of worrying about losing lives or scores, players can focus entirely on
            controlling the car and completing their delivery tasks. This feature creates a light-hearted gaming
            environment
            that encourages creativity and experimentation in gameplay."

            I am thrilled to see that this project not only brings joy to players but also helps me explore game design
            and
            create interesting and innovative gameplay mechanics. This is my first Unity project, and this experience
            has
            deepened my understanding of the game development process. I hope the game will provide relaxing and
            enjoyable
            moments for all players, while also serving as a stepping stone for my future game projects!
