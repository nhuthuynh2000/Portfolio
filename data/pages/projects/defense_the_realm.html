        "I have developed a tower defense game, similar to many others in the genre, where players start with a set
        amount of money to build defense towers. Players must strategically calculate the paths of enemies to protect
        their base. Instead of using a traditional HP system for the base, I implemented a mechanic where each enemy
        that enters the base deducts money from the player. If the player's funds drop below zero, it's game over. This
        adds an additional layer of strategy, as players must be cautious about keeping their money above a critical
        threshold."

        "In this project, I gained experience with pathfinding methods. When a tower is placed in front of an enemy, the
        enemy recalculates its path to find an alternate route. I also utilized pooling techniques to manage game
        objects efficiently. Notably, this is my first 3D game, and the experience has significantly broadened my
        understanding of game development concepts. I am excited to continue exploring new techniques and creating
        engaging gameplay experiences in my future projects!"
